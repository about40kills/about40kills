# How to Add Your Logo

The Google Drive link you provided has redirect issues. To add your logo:

1. Download your logo image from Google Drive manually
2. Save it as `logo.png` in the `public` folder
3. The navbar will automatically display it

The logo should be:

- Square or circular format works best
- Recommended size: 512x512px or larger
- Format: PNG, JPG, or WebP

Current path: `public/logo.png`
